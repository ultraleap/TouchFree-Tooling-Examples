# Border Progress Example

This example shows a button style that provides visual feedback showing when and where the user is going to interact with the UI. This is achieved through animation applied to the button that reacts to the `ProgressToClick` value provided by TouchFree. As this value increases, the border of the buttons will fill out giving an indication as to how close to the click the user is.

## Setup

1. Ensure that the [TouchFree Service](https://docs.ultraleap.com/touchfree-user-manual/#touchfree-service) is running. [Download the installer here](https://developer.leapmotion.com/touchfree).
2. Clone the repo and find the example you want to try
3. Run `npm install`
4. Run `npm test` to run the tests
5. Run `npm start` and open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

This example is best viewed with the browser window maximised.

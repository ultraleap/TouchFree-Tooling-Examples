## Animated Progress Buttons
![Animated Buttons Showing Progress To Click](Media/ProgressButtonsExample.gif)

This example shows a button style that provides visual feedback showing when and where the user is going to interact with the UI. This is achieved through animation applied to the button that reacts to the `ProgressToClick` value provided by TouchFree. The result is a UI that feels connected to the movement of your hand.

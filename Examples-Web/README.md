# TouchFree Tooling Examples for Web

Examples of touchless content only possible through using [Touchfree Tooling](https://github.com/ultraleap/TouchFree).

## Setup

Wave Progress Button is set up slightly differently as it is a react app. The WaveProgressButton folder contains a readme on how to setup that example.

1. Ensure that the [Touchfree](https://github.com/ultraleap/TouchFree) Service is running.
2. Clone the repo and find the example you want to try
3. Open the include html file in your browser

These examples are best viewed fullscreen.

## Animated Progress Buttons

These examples show button styles that provide visual feedback showing when and where the user is going to interact with the UI. This is achieved through animation applied to the button that reacts to the `ProgressToClick` value provided by TouchFree. The result is a UI that feels connected to the movement of your hand.

## Animated Progress Buttons

These examples show button styles that provide visual feedback showing when and where the user is going to interact with the UI. This is achieved through animation applied to the button that reacts to the `ProgressToClick` value provided by TouchFree. The result is a UI that feels connected to the movement of your hand.
